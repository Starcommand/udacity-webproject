      <h3>What is the World Wide Web?</h3>
      <p>The web was invented in the early 1990s. It is a collection of HTML documents that allows website creation. HTML supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files. This means you can jump from page to page which is considered
        <em>Hyperlink</em>.

      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It is a standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> describes "what it looks like".

      <h3>Why are Computers Stupid?</h3>
      <p> <span> Computers are often described as being stupid by programmers because it is unambiguous when given instructions</span>. Since the computer interprets language literally the programmer will likely run into problems.

      <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
      <p>HTML elements can either be a <b>block element</b> or <b>inline element</b>. A block element creates an "invisible box" around the content. And an inline element does not start on a new line. It only takes as much width it requires.
